        <p>A digital wallet is a base58 encoded hash.  It is a public address that can be used to access public account information as well as sending and receiving XRP.
        <h4>How do I send XRP to a Digital Wallet?</h4>
        <p>Sending XRP to a wallet is called a Transaction.  A Transaction must be created through the RippleAPI, or one of the digital currency exchanges online.  Once a transaction is created, it must be authenticated with the secret key of the wallet being withdrawn from.  Finally, it must be submitted to the Ripple network for the transaction to be recorded into the public ledger, and the transfer of XRP to be actualized.</p>
        <h4>How do I create a Transaction?</h4>
        <p>To create a transaction requires at least two public addresses:  The wallet being withdrawn from, and the wallet being deposited to.</p>
